        <section class="about">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a passionate and curious learner currently studying Game Design and Development at Eduvos, with a completed Software Engineering 
               bootcamp from HyperionDev. My background combines a strong foundation in coding principles with a growing interest in interactive 
               design and user-focused development.</p>
            
            <p>I’m most comfortable programming in Python, and have also worked with Delphi and JavaScript at a basic level. I enjoy building things independently and experimenting with new concepts. What drives me is the thrill of solving problems, the challenge of learning something new, and the satisfaction that comes from creating tools that are both helpful and usable.</p>
            
            <p>My long-term goal is to become a full-stack developer and work on projects that combine front-end creativity with back-end logic. I’m constantly seeking opportunities to grow my skills, contribute to real-world software, and turn my passion for coding into a meaningful career.</p>
